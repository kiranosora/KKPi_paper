%\section{BESIII Detector and Data Sets}
%\label{sec:detector_dataset}
%The BESIII detector is a magnetic spectrometer~\cite{BESIII} located at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPCII)~\cite{BEPCII}.
%The subdetectors surrounded by the superconducting solenoidal magnet, which provide a 1.0 T magnetic field, starting from the interaction point consist of  a main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time of flight counters (TOF), a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC).
%Charged particle identification is performed by combining the ionization energy loss  measured by MDC and the time-of-flight measured by TOF.
%EMC provides the shower information to reconstruct photons.
%Outside the solenoidal magnet is a multi-gap resistive-plate chamber system (MRPC), which provides muon identification.
%
%Monte Carlo (MC) samples are produced with the GEANT4-based~\cite{GEANT4} package.
%An inclusive MC sample is produced at $E_{cm}$ = 4.178 GeV.
%The sample includes all known open charm decays, the continuum processes ( $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow q\bar{q}$, q = u, d and s), Bhabha scattering, $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, diphoton process and the $c\bar{c}$ resonances $J/\psi$, $\psi(3686)$ and $\psi(3770)$ via the initial state radiation (ISR).
%The generator CONEXC~\cite{CONEXC} is used to model the open charm processes directly produced via $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation.
%The simulation of ISR production of $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(3686)$ and $J/\psi$ is performed with the KKMC~\cite{KKMC} package.
%The final-state radiation from charged tracks is produced by the PHOTOS package~\cite{PHOTOS}.
%The known decays with BFs taken from Particle Data Group (PDG)~\cite{PDG} are simulated with the EVTGEN package~\cite{EVTGEN} and
%the unknown decays are generated with the LUNDCHARM model~\cite{LUNDCHARM}.
%The inclusive MC (generic MC) is used to perform background analysis.

%\section{Event Selection}
%\label{chap:event_selection}
%%\label{selection}
%For charged tracks except for those from $K_{S}^{0}$ decays, the polar angles ($\theta$) respect to the beam axis  must satisfy $|cos\theta| < 0.93$.
%The distances of charged tracks from the interaction point in the transverse plane and along the beam direction should be less than 1 cm and 10 cm, respectively.
%
%Photons are reconstructed from the cluster shower in EMC.
%The deposit energy of the photons from the endcap ($0.86 < |cos\theta| < 0.92$) should be larger than 50 MeV and that of the photons from the barrel ($|cos\theta| < 0.8$) should be larger than 25 MeV.
%Furthermore, the shower time from the event start time should be within 700 ns.
%
%We reconstruct $\pi^{0} (\eta)$ candidates through $\pi^{0} \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ ($\eta \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$).
%The diphoton invariant mass $M_{\gamma\gamma}$ for $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ should be in the range of 0.115 $< M_{\gamma\gamma} <$ 0.150 GeV/$c^{2}$ and 0.490 $< M_{\gamma\gamma} <$ 0.580 GeV/$c^{2}$, respectively.
%Then we perform a fit to constrain $M_{\gamma\gamma}$ to the $\pi^{0}$ or $\eta$ nominal mass ~\cite{PDG}.
%The $\pi^{0}$ or $\eta$ candidates with a $\chi^{2}_{1C}$ less than 30 are retained.
%
%Kaons and pions are identified by the combining the information of dE/dx in the MDC and the time-of-flight from the TOF.
%If the probability of the kaon hypothesis is larger than that of the pion hypothesis, the charged track is identified as a kaon.
%Otherwise, the track is identified as a pion.
%
%We vote the $\pi^{\pm}$ and $pi^{0}$ whose momentum is less than 0.1 GeV to remove soft $\pi^{\pm}$ and $\pi^{0}$ from $D^{*}$ decays.
%
%The $\eta^{'}$ candidates are reconstructed via the process $\eta^{'} \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\eta$.
%The candidates with an invarian mass for $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\eta$ falling into the range of $[0.938, 0.978]$ GeV/$c^{2}$ are retained.
%
%$\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pairs are used to reconstruct $K_{S}^{0}$ mesons.
%The polar angles $\theta$ of the two pions should satisfy $|cos\theta| < 0.93$.
%The distances of the two pions should from the interaction point along the beam direction should be less than 20 cm. 
%The invariant mass $M(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pairs  should satisfy $0.487 < |cos\theta| < 0.511$ GeV/$c^{2}$.
%The decay length and the decay length error of $K_{S}^{0}$ are obtained with second vertex fit.
%We require the decay length over the decay length error to be less than 2.
%
%Then the $D_{s}$ candidates are reconstructed from $K^{\pm}$, $\pi^{\pm}$, $\eta$, $\eta^{'}$, $K_{S}^{0}$ and $\pi^{0}$.
%We reserve the candidates with an invariant mass $M(D_{s}$ falling in the mass window $[1.87, 2.06]$ GeV/$c^{2}$ and an recoiling mass $M_{rec}$ falling in the mass window $[2.051, 2.180]$ GeV/$c^{2}$.
%$M_{rec}$ is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
%    M_{rec} = \sqrt{(E_{cm} - \sqrt{| \vec p_{D_{s}} |^{2} + m_{D_{s}}^{2}})^{2} - |\vec p_{cm} - \vec p_{D_{s}} | ^{2}} \; , \label{con:inventoryflow}
%\end{equation}
%where $p_{D_{s}}$ is the momentum of $D_{s}$ candidate, $m_{D_{s}}$ is $D_{s}$ mass quoted from PDG~\cite{PDG},
%and $\vec p_{cm}$ and $\vec p_{D_{s}}$ are the momentum of the initial state and the decay products of the $D_{s}$ candidate, respectively.
